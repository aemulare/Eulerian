# Eulerian

A short program that finds an Eulerian circuit or an Eulerian path in a graph represented by adjacency matrix.

## Project Assignment

> Given an adjacency matrix that codes for a graph, write a program that determines if there is an Eulerian circuit, an Eulerian path, or neither.  
If a circuit or a path exists, state the path.
